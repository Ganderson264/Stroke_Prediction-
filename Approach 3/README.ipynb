    "# Stroke Prediction Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke. Utilizing the Random Forest classification algorithm, the model processes health-related features to estimate stroke risk. Special attention was given to addressing class imbalance with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), refining features through selection techniques, and hyperparameter tuning using grid search for optimal model performance.\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "Run the model prediction with the following command:\n",
    "python predict.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Development\n",
    "After cloning the project, create a virtual environment and activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",

    "- `BMI`: Body Mass Index of the patient.\n",
    "- `Smoking Status`: Patient's smoking habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is 'Stroke' with binary outcomes: '1' for Stroke and '0' for No Stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Random Forest model includes key hyperparameters such as:\n",
